<h1 align='center'>blek! Site</h1>
<hr/>
Source code of my <a href='https://blek.codes'>website</a>

# This repo has been deprecated.
As the code is of extremely low quality and is barely readable, I  
made a decision to switch to Express.JS and Pug from Laravel.

New site's repo is [homepage.js](https://git.blek.codes/blek/homepage.js)

### Common problems
#### Can't log into database: role '***' does not exist
Back up your data, delete db directory, check again
