    <h2>About me</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        My name is Alice and im a trans girl from Russia.<br/>
        I like to build software in my free time<br/>
        <br/>
        I am currently watching
        <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110'>Mr. Robot</a>,
        and i can recommend some other series for you to watch:<br/>
        <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2741602'>Blacklist</a>,
        <a href='https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375692'>Black Sails</a>
    </p>

        If anyone needs help with programming (with pretty much everything programming related i guess),<br/>
        i usually hang out on
        <span style='background:#33333333;padding:2px 6px;border-radius:3px;border:1px solid #3a3c3a33;user-select:all'>#just_stuff</span>
        on libera chat, if you'd mention my nickname in a channel i would get a notification (don't DM me)<br/>

        To be honest, i am in a very unstable state of mind right now.<br/>
        Im not totally out (yet), and i have to make a decision:
        Whether to come out or kill myself. I unironically feel like im a fault. A fault that has to be removed.
        And i can't just come out and transition, im just too shit scared of that. More to that, getting HRT in russia is nearly impossible.<br/>
        <br/>
        My depression literally ate through my brains. I can't tell anymore if its reality or my imagination.
        For all i know, i could be dying in a strip club somewhere in Mexico imagining writing all this.<br/>
        I don't think i can recover from this.<br/>
        <br/>
        You know, when i look at other trans people, especially those who don't pass, i admire them.
        They have the strength to reclaim their life. They have the strength to fight the whole world for their identity.
        I don't have anywhere near that kind of strength. Obviously, everyone has their "ups" and "downs", but i didn't had
        an "up" in quite a while. I am just falling down, deeper than i ever was.<br/>
        <br/>
        Probably publishing this in public is not a very good idea, but i don't give a shit anymore. Im fucking done hiding.<br/>
        I am most likely be dead in a month or two. I don't have any regrets. I don't mind dying right now for that matter.
